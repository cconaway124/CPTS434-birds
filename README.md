# CPTS434-birds

## This is a project I did to work with Convolutional Neural Networks

I wanted to test out structures like AlexNet, ResNet, but I wanted to build them myself. If you want to run the code, you need to upload a kaggle.json with an api-key in it. This allows the kaggle file (which is huge) to be downloaded automatically. The notebook *should* be able to take it from there. You also need to make sure that you have a content folder in the directory above your current directory, and a data folder in that folder.

## Colab

I ran this in the colab environment because the stress on my computer was too great. That is why the 500 species didn't finish. 

## Results

We achieved fantastic results for the 3, 5, and 10 bird classification, around a 90% or above accuracy rate.
